# Image-Processing-in-Verilog-

This repository contains a hardware-based image processing system implemented in Verilog. The design focuses on real-time image manipulation, making it suitable for FPGA-based vision systems, embedded applications, and digital signal processing (DSP).

ðŸ”¹ Features
âœ” Pixel-level processing for real-time computation
âœ” Modular Verilog design for flexibility and scalability
âœ” Supports basic image transformations, including:

Grayscale conversion
Edge detection (Sobel, Prewitt)
Thresholding & contrast enhancement
Image filtering (Mean, Gaussian, Median)
âœ” FPGA synthesizable for hardware acceleration
âœ” Testbench included for functional verification
